To streamline the setup, two bash scripts are provided for installing dependencies and starting the application.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/sveld03/cs35l_project.git

2. Install Dependencies

Run the provided installation script to check for Golang and install Node.js dependencies:

bash install

This script performs the following:
	â€¢	Verifies if Golang is installed.
	â€¢	Installs Node.js dependencies in both the healthyonthehill and backend directories concurrently.

3. Start the Application

Run the startup script to launch all services:

bash start

This script performs the following:
	â€¢	Starts the React frontend.
	â€¢	Launches the two Go servers for gym activity and dining hall APIs.
	â€¢	Starts the Node.js backend for user authentication.

4. Access the Application

Once all servers are running, open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:3000
